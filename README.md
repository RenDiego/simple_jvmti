## history

The orginal version of the `jvmti_wrapper` and `jvmti_sys` is not available from `github.com`([link](https://github.com/ldhdev916/jvmti_wrapper)). So I cannot fork the repository to improve the functionality. But the code is available from `docs.rs`. The first commit is copied code from [jvmti_wrapper](https://docs.rs/crate/jvmti_wrapper/latest/source/) and [jvmti_sys](https://docs.rs/crate/jvmti_sys/latest/source/).
